## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to the **State-Wise Constituency Analysis Dashboard** repository! This Power BI project provides a detailed and interactive analysis of **constituency electors across Indian states**, political parties, and alliances. The dashboard is designed to support **election analysis, political research, and strategic decision-making** through clear and insightful visualizations.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to understand how constituency electors are distributed across India and how they are represented by different political parties and coalitions. The dashboard transforms raw election data into meaningful insights that are easy to explore and interpret.

Key questions addressed:
- How many **states** are included in the dataset?
- What is the **total number of constituency electors**?
- How are electors distributed **state-wise**?
- Which **political parties** hold the highest number of electors?
- How does elector distribution vary across **coalitions**?

## 🔄 Data Transformation
The dataset was loaded into **Power BI Desktop** and transformed using **Power Query**. The following steps were performed:

- Data cleaning and validation
- Standardization of state and party names
- Removal of inconsistencies and null values
- Structuring data for analysis and visualization

These steps ensured high data quality and reliable insights.

## 🧩 Data Modelling
Data modeling was carried out by creating relationships between tables based on appropriate **keys**. A well-structured data model enabled efficient filtering, accurate aggregation, and smooth interaction across all visuals in the dashboard.

## 📐 Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
Key measures and calculated fields were created using **DAX** to support dashboard KPIs and visuals, including:

- Total States
- Total Constituency Electors
- Constituency Electors by State
- Constituency Electors by Party
- Coalition-wise Elector Distribution

These measures allow real-time interactivity and dynamic insights.

## 📊 Dashboard
The dashboard was developed using **Power BI Desktop** after creating the data model and DAX measures. It includes:

- **KPI Cards** showing Total States and Total Constituency Electors
- **Bar Charts** for Party-wise and State-wise elector distribution
- **Map Visualization** to display geographical distribution across India
- **Slicers** for State and Party to enable interactive analysis
